//! AWS Signature Version 4 request signing — hand-rolled on ring (digest + hmac), no AWS
//! SDK. MOVED VERBATIM from the identity unit's `egress_auth/sigv4/mod.rs` in the kernel, staged
//! `busbar-auth-outbound::sigv4` (KERNEL<>PLUGINS step 22), then here (AUTH-SPLIT: sigv4 is its
//! own mechanism, its own crate): the canonical-request -> string-to-sign -> signature chain is
//! verified against AWS's own published worked example (GET iam ListUsers, 2015-08-30) in the
//! tests, so correctness does not rely on trusting the move.
//!
//! Two changes, both at the edge of the chain and neither touching a signed byte:
//!
//! * THE DAILY KEY (BUSBAR-1.6.0.md THE DESIGN, §6.5: "SigV4 signs per request with a daily signing key derived
//!   ahead of time"): [`sign_v4`] is split into [`signing_key`] (the HMAC chain over date, region,
//!   service) and [`sign_v4_with_key`] (the per-request part), so a caller holding the day's key
//!   signs without re-deriving it. [`sign_v4`] is the two composed, exactly the old function.
//! * THE SECRET IS ZEROISED (TODO item 586, #53/#54): the `AWS4<secret>` key material and every
//!   derived key are [`Zeroizing`] buffers, wiped on drop.
//!
//! The signer's chain is shared with the INBOUND check ([`crate::inbound`], moved here from the
//! kernel): it recomputes a client's signature through [`hmac`], [`signing_key`] and [`sha256_hex`],
//! and derives the canonical URI with [`uri_encode_path`], keeping its own canonical signing (a
//! quoted header value's interior spaces are kept verbatim there).
